# C-Python-Simple-Program
A simple program that takes a list of inputs and does one of three operations on them. That being counting the repetition of each item, the frequency of one item, and a histogram of items.

This program was made as a school project which will correctly perform the above actions upon being given the proper inputs. (That being a valid txt file and commands)

This could be improved on by allowing for extra input from the user and taking in any manner of capitalization instead of exact word matching.

The most challenging part of this project was getting most of the code to function withing my version of VSCode as well as getting the frequency of a single item working. I managed to tinker with the code to count from the entire file to make the searched word the selected user input, and I somewhat fixed the issue of getting it running by using an external compiler. As many projects, looking at online resources is the best way to figure out how to get things working.

This project will allow me to use more programming languages at the same time in future projects.

I made this program readable by naming each function by what they do, formatting everything in an easy to read fashion, and having short and efficient snippets of code that do what the project required.

The frequency file is an empty file that takes in items during usage of the program and is later used for the histogram.
The PythonCode file contains the functions that allow the program to manage data.
The Source file has the default code from the original project (Which may have issues running on some systems).
The PInput file contains the program's input which is an itemized list of items.
