# C-Python-Simple-Program
A simple program that takes a list of inputs and does one of three operations on them. That being counting the repetition of each item, the frequency of one item, and a histogram of items.

The frequency file is an empty file that takes in items during usage of the program and is later used for the histogram.
The PythonCode file contains the functions that allow the program to manage data.
The Source file has the default code from the original project (Which may have issues running on some systems).
